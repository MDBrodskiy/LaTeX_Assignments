\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item The potential energy of water or the tendency of water to move. It is represented by the Greek letter: $\Psi$

  \item Water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential

  \item Water movement will occur until the water potential inside the cell equals the water potential outside of the cell (equilibrium)

  \item Osmolarity $-$ A measure of solute concentration. High osmolarity is a high solute concentration

\end{itemize}
