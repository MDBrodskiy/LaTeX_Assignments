\begin{itemize}

  \item Cell Division/Asexual Reproduction

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Produce cells with same information, identical daughter cells

      \item Exact copies or clones

      \item Same amount of DNA, same chromosomes, same information

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Pairs 1-22 are autosomes, while other pairs are sex chromosomes

  \item Homologous chromosomes:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Paired chromosomes

      \item Both chromosomes of a pair carry ``matching'' genes

      \item Control same inherited characters

      \item \textcolor{red}{homo}\textcolor{green}{logous} = \textcolor{red}{same} \textcolor{green}{information} 

      \item Diploid means two of every chromosome ($2n$, or $2n=4$)

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Sperm and Egg are gametes, all other cells are somatic

  \item Sperm and Egg are made through meiosis, and are fused in fertilization

  \item Gametes are haploid, 1n cells, which are then fertilized into diploid, 2n cells, which, in turn, causes meiosis to occur, creating more haploid, 1n cells

  \item Double Division of Meiosis:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item First Division of meiosis separates homologous pairs (reduction phase)

      \item Second Division of meiosis separates sister chromatids 

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Trading pieces of DNA:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item In meiosis I, sister chromatids intertwine, known as ``crossing over''

      \item Homologous pairs swap pieces of chromosomes

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Crossing Over results in genetic variation and new traits

      \hline
      No crossing over & Crossing over \\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}

\item Value of Sexual Reproduction:

  \begin{enumerate}

    \item Introduces genetic recombination (depends on assortment of chromosomes, and alignment of traits in Metaphase 1)

    \item Crossing over mixes alleles across homologous chromosomes

    \item Random fertilization, as it depends on which two cells will fertilize

    \item Drives evolution

  \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
