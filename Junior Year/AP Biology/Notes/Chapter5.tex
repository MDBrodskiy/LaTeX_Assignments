\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item There are four main macromolecules:
    
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Carbohydrate

      \item Lipids
        
      \item Proteins

      \item Nucleic Acids

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Proteins are the most complex out of the four molecules

  \item There are two forms of macromolecules:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Monomer $-$ The smallest unit of a macromolecule

      \item Polymer $-$ A larger molecule made up of smaller monomers

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Dehydration Synthesis $-$ Two hydrogen and one oxygen are removed from smaller molecules, allowing bonds to form more complex molecules

  \item Hydrolysis $-$ Reverse of Dehydration Synthesis, -lysis ending means breaking. Water is required for this

  \item Carbohydrates:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item These are sugars and starches

      \item Monomers made up of C, H, and O (1:2:1 ratio)

      \item Short-term energy storage and structures

      \item Monomer $-$ Monosaccharides

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Examples: Glucose, Galactose, \& Fructose

          \item Combination of two forms Disaccharides, created through dehydration synthesis (Glucose + Glucose = Maltose, Glucose + Fructose = Sucrose, Glucose + Galactose = Lactose)

        \end{enumerate}

      \item Polymer $-$ Polysaccharide

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Glucose polymers have two main functions: Energy Storage for short term, amylose in plants and glycogen in animals, and Structural support, mostly in plants, as cellulose

          \item Starch vs Cellulose $-$ Starches are alpha linked, whereas cellulose is beta linked

        \end{enumerate}

      \item Herbivores:

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Termites $-$ Symbiotic relationship with a protist, which lives in the termite's gut. This protist digests cellulose

          \item Ruminants $-$ Cows are an example. Cows have bacteria that break down the cellulose, while the cow keeps regurgitating it

          \item Caecophores $-$ Bunnies are an example. They process the cellulose by eating some of their cecal (pre-fecal) matter, as the cellulose is only partly digested before it comes out

        \end{enumerate}

      \item Chitin $-$ A modified polysaccharide that exits in fungi, arthropod exoskeletons, and dissolving stitches

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Lipids:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Exist as fats, oils, and waxes

      \item Made up with C, H, O

      \item Used for long-term storage and insulation

      \item No polymers

      \item Three groups: Triglycerides, Phospholipids, and Steroids
        
        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Triglycerides are made of one glycerol \& 3 fatty acids

          \item Triglycerides are connected by dehydration synthesis three times

          \item Saturated Fat $-$ No double bonds between carbons

          \item Unsaturated Fat $-$ At least one double bond (kinked), this influences the properties of the lipid. Unsaturated stay liquid at room temperature.

          \item Phospholipids are a modified version of the triglyceride, but with a phosphate rather than a fatty acid

          \item Phospholipids have a polar and non-polar region

          \item Big part of cell membranes, arranged in a bi-layer

          \item Steroids are made up of cholesterol and some types of hormones

          \item Steroids' structures are shaped as fused rings

          \item Have a variety of functions (functional groups)

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Proteins:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item The most complex biomolecule

      \item Made up of C, H, O, N, \& a little S

      \item Used in all life functions

      \item Monomer: Amino Acids (joined together by peptide bonds)

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Built of amino ($NH_2$) group and Carboxyl group, attached to a central alpha carbon, and $R$ group

          \item $R$ group defines the amino acid (without it, they are all the same)

          \item N-terminus, the end of the amino group, connects to the C-terminus, the end of the carboxyl group


        \end{enumerate}

      \item Polymer: Protein (Polypeptide)

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Primary Structure $-$ The sequence of amino acids in one polypeptide chain

          \item Happens when peptide bonds between amino acids

          \item Secondary Structure $-$ A regular, repeating 3D structure found in all polypeptide chains

          \item Alpha Helix and Beta-Pleated Sheet

          \item Happens when hydrogen bonds between atoms in the CN backbone of the polypeptide (no R-groups involved)

          \item Tertiary Structure $-$ The specific 3D shape of a particular polypeptide chain (the conformation)

          \item Happens when there is interaction between two R-groups of different atoms in cell
            
          \item Quaternary Structure $-$ The specific 3D shape of any protein that is made up of more that one polypeptide chain (many are). The only ``Optional'' level of structure

          \item The overall structure when multiple chains form a functional protein

          \end{enumerate}

        \item Different types of proteins:

          \begin{enumerate}

            \item Storage Proteins $-$ Store amino acids

            \item Hormonal Proteins $-$ Responsible for coordination of an organisms activities

            \item Structural Proteins $-$ Support structures

            \item Defensive Proteins $-$ Protect against disease (by holding antibodies)

            \item Transport Protein $-$ Transports substances

            \item Receptor Proteins $-$ Response of cell to chemical stimuli

            \item Contractile and Motor Proteins $-$ Responsible for movement

            \item Enzymatic Proteins $-$ Selective acceleration of chemical reactions

          \end{enumerate}

        \item Sickle Cell Anemia $-$ An example of the relationship between protein structure and organismal physiology. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in red blood cells. This anemia is caused by the replacement of glutamic acid with valine. Valine is hydrophobic, so the cell moves away from water, instead of glutamic acid, which is hydrophilic

        \item Denaturation $-$ Change in the structure of a protein. Denatured proteins do not work well. Denaturing may be caused by heat, pH imbalance, etc
        
    \end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}
