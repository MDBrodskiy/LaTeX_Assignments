\begin{itemize}

  \item Procedure: Different amounts of sugar are added to water to form solutions of various molarities, which are then colored differently. Potatoes are massed and then added to each of the solutions. After 24 hours, the mass of the potatoes in each solution is recorded. From there, the molarity of each solution needs to be determined.

\end{itemize}
