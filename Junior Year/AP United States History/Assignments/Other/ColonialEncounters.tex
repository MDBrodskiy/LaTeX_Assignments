  Theodore De Bry, Columbus's First Encounter with Natives, 1505
\begin{tabular}{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
\hline
What do you see? & Interpret what you saw \\
\hline
Columbus has arrived with his crew to the New World & The armor they are wearing may signify they are ready for conquest \\
People are putting up a cross in the background & This exemplifies one of the three Gs, God \\
Ships standing in smooth seas & This could connect with religion, as it could be god's will for them to have smooth sailing \\
Generous natives are giving Columbus's crew jewelry and other stuff & This shows what the book described: the natives were hospitable and forthcoming, while explorers took advantage of this\\
Natives in the background look like they are getting shot & This shows the cruelty and violence exerted upon the natives by Columbus and other explorers \\

Unknown Artist, circa 1777
\begin{tabular}{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
\hline
What do you see? & Interpret what you saw \\
\hline
Native giving explorers cloth & This could mean one of two things: either the native is generous, or the explorers are forcing him to do this \\
A native and an explorer are smoking a pipe & This serves to show that the two are not so different after all \\
Native holding a bow & This most likely shows that the native wants to be armed whenever he deals with the explorers\\

Granger, Attack on Pequot For, 1637
\begin{tabular}{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
\hline
What do you see? & Interpret what you saw \\
\hline
Fires raging in the background & This is meant to highlight the savagery of the explorers\\
Explorers shooting at the natives & Much like the fires, this highlights the atrocities the explorers committed \\
Natives holding shields and running & This shows that the natives were unable to defend from the weapons of the Europeans \\
