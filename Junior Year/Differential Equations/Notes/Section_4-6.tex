\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item The general solution of a first order linear DE is of form \eqref{1}

    \begin{equation}
      y=c_1e^{-\int P(x)\,dx}+e^{-\int P(x)\,dx}\int e^{\int P(x)\,dx}f(x)\,dx
      \label{1}
    \end{equation}

  \item A way to attain a solution is \textbf{Variation of Parameters}.

  \item For a second order DE, use $y_p(x)=u_1(x)y_1(x)+u_2(x)y_2(x)$

\end{itemize}
