\begin{itemize}

  \item The derivative of a transform is: $\mathcal{L}\left\{ t^nf(t) \right\}=(-1)^n\frac{d^n}{ds^n}F(s)$

  \item A convolution (f convolves g) is defined as \eqref{1}

    \begin{equation}
      f\ast g=\int_0^t f(\tau)g(t-\tau)\,d\tau
      \label{1}
    \end{equation}

\end{itemize}
