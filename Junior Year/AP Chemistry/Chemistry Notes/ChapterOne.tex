\begin{itemize}

  \item Pure Matter $-$ Only one thing. Can be an atom or a compound.

  \item Mixture $-$ More than one thing.

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Homogenous: Evenly distributed

      \item Heterogenous: Not homogenous

    \end{itemize}

  \item Separation of Mixtures:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Distillation $-$ Based on boiling into vapor and cooling vapor down

      \item Extraction $-$ Based on solubility

      \item Filtration $-$ Based on size

      \item Chromatography $-$ Based on affinities/attraction (significantly more complex than others)

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Measurements: Length, Volume, Mass, Temp, Pressure

  \item \begin{tabular}{c c c}
      Temp & Freeze & Boil \\
      \hline
      Fahrenheit & 32 & 212 \\
      Celsius & 0 & 100\\
      Kelvin & 273 & 373 \\
    \end{tabular}

  \item All measurements have uncertainty. The less uncertainty, the more accurate a measuring device is.

  \item Significant Figure Counting Rules:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item All non-zeros count

      \item Zeros

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Leading $-$ Never count

          \item Captive $-$ Always count

          \item Trailing $-$ Count if right of decimal count, or left of a decimal point

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{center} Ex. 505 has 3 significant figures, 500 has one \end{center}

\end{itemize}
