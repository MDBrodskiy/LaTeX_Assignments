\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \ce{4S + 3O2 -> 2S2O3}\\
    m_{\ce{S}} & = .012\cdot10000 \\
    & = 120[\si{\gram}_{\ce{S}}] \\
    \si{\mole}_{\ce{S}} & = \frac{120}{32}\cdot\frac{1}{4} \\
  & = .9375[\si{\mole}_{\ce{S}}]\rightarrow 1.875[\si{\mole}_{\ce{S2O3}}] \\
  m_{\ce{S2O3}} & = 1.875\cdot112\\
  & = 210[\si{\gram}_{\ce{S2O3}}] \\
  V=\frac{m}{\rho} & = \frac{210}{2.6} \\
  & V=80.77[\si{\liter}]  
\end{split}
  \label{1}
\end{equation}\footnote{I believe you may have meant to put $\si{\gram\per\milli\liter}$, as the answer comes out to be somewhat strange}
