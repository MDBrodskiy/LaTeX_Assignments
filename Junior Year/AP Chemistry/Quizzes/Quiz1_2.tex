\begin{enumerate}

  \item The area of the 48 contiguous states is $3.02\cdot10^6[mi^2]$.  Assume that these states are completely flat (no mountains and no valleys).  What volume, in liters, would cover these states with rainfall of two inches?  $(1[L] = 1000[mL]; mL = cm^3; 1[mi] = 1609[m];  2.54 [cm] = 1[in];  100[cm] = 1[m])$

    $$A_{base}=3.02\cdot10^6[mi^2]=7.82\cdot10^{12}[\si{\meter\squared}]$$
    $$h=2[in]=.0508[\si{\meter}]$$
    $$V=Ah=7.82\cdot10^{12}\cdot.0508=3.973\cdot10^{11}[\si{\meter\cubed}]$$
    $$3.973\cdot10^{11}[\si{\meter\cubed}]=3.97\cdot10^{14}[\si{\liter}]$$

\end{enumerate}
