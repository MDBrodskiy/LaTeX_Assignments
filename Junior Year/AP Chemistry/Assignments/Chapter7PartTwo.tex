  \item In each of the following molecules, a central atom is surrounded by a total of three atoms or unshared electron pairs: \ce{SnCl2}, \ce{BCl3}, and \ce{SO2}. In which of these molecules would you expect the bond angle to be less than $120^{\circ}$? Explain your reasoning.

    \begin{center}
      \ce{SnCl2} and \ce{SO2} would most likely have a bond angle less than $120^{\circ}$. This is because both molecules fit the ``bent'' molecular shape, which is polarized with an angle of $109.5^{\circ}$. This is because of the lone pair of electrons on both of the central atoms.
