\begin{enumerate}

  \item How many grams of hydrogen is needed to fill a $80[\si{\liter}]$ tank to a pressure of $150[\si{\atm}]$ at $27[^{\circ}\si{\Celsius}]$? \eqref{1}

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
        n&=\frac{PV}{RT}\\
        \frac{150\cdot80}{.0821\cdot300}&=487.211[\si{\mole}]\\
        2\cdot487&=974[\si{\gram}_{\ce{H}}]\\
      \end{split}
      \label{1}
    \end{equation}

  \item At what temperature does $16.3[\si{\gram}]$ of nitrogen have a pressure of $725[\si{\torr}]$ in a $25[\si{\liter}]$ tank? \eqref{2}

    \begin{equation}
      \begin{split}
      725[\si{\torr}]&=.954[\si{\atm}]\\
      \frac{16.3}{28}&=.582[\si{\mole}_{\ce{N}}]\\
      T&=\frac{25\cdot.954}{.582\cdot.0821}\\
      &=499[^{\circ}\si{\kelvin}]
    \end{split}
      \label{2}
    \end{equation}

  \item What is the volume, in $[\si{\milli\liter}]$, of $837[\si{\milli\gram}]$ of xenon gas at STP? \eqref{3}

      \begin{equation}
        \begin{split}
          837[\si{\milli\gram}]&=.837[\si{\gram}]\\
          V_{\si{\milli\liter}}&=\frac{1}{1000}\cdot
        \end{split}
        \label{3}
      \end{equation}

    \item A gas at STP is in a $25[\si{\liter}]$ container.  The volume is increased to $50[\si{\liter}]$ and pressure is increased to $1.5[\si{\atm}]$.  What is new temperature?  

    \item A balloon is filled with $1.0[\si{\liter}]$ of helium at $1.0[\si{\atm}]$ and a starting temp.  The balloon rises to a point where the pressure is $220[\si{\torr}]$, temp is $-31[^{\circ}\si{\Celsius}]$, and the volume increases to $2.8[\si{\liter}]$.  What is the starting temp of the balloon? 

    \item How many grams of gas must be released from a $45.2[\si{\liter}]$ sample of nitrogen at STP to reduce the volume to $45[\si{\liter}]$ at STP? 

    \item A neon sign is made of glass tubing whose inside diameter is $2.0[\si{\centi\meter}]$ and whose length is $4.0[\si{\centi\meter}]$.  If the sign contains neon at a pressure of $1.5[\si{\torr}]$ at $35[^{\circ}\si{\Celsius}]$, how many grams of neon are in the sign? ($V=\pi r^2 h$)

    \item Calculate the number of molecules in a deep breath of air whose volume is $2.55[\si{\liter}]$ at body temp of $37[^{\circ}\si{\Celsius}]$, and a pressure of $740[\si{\torr}]$. 

\end{enumerate}
