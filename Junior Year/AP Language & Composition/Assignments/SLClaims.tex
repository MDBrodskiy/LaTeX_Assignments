\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Claim: In \textit{The Scarlet Letter}, Nathaniel Hawthorne portrays the town as a failed paradisiacal society, by highlighting theoretically uncharacteristic parts of utopia, such as a large jail containing many people, a graveyard, and a dreary and judgmental people.
    
    \setcounter{enumi}{0}

  \item Evidence: ``The founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project, have \dots a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a prison.''

  \item Claim: In \textit{The Scarlet Letter}, Hawthorne introduces the townfolk as a homogenized, drearily-dressed group, all of whom looked and acted in the same, judgmental fashion.

    \setcounter{enumi}{1}

  \item Evidence: ``A throng of bearded men, in sad-colored garments and gray, steeple-crowned hats, intermixed with women, some wearing hoods, and others bareheaded\dots''

\end{enumerate}
