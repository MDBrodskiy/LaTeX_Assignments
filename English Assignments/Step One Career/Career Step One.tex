        "Nuclear physicists study the way atoms interact with each other, as well as how the characteristics of the nuclear world can be applied to human endeavors. Nuclear physicists may focus on one of several subspecialties including theoretical work, experimental examinations of nuclear particles and equipment design." The most concise way to describe a Nuclear Physicist's work is as follows: a Nuclear Physicist takes known theories, both scientific and mathematical, and applies those theories, possibly in conjunction with his or her own, to expand the field of Nuclear Science.
