  \begin{justifying}

    \paragraph{} When this is all over, I want to be able to call myself an honest\footnote{By honest I am implying efficient use without relying on perpetual visual keyboard stimulation} \emph{Vimmer}, or user of Vim. What is Vim\footnote{Vim \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)}{wikpedia}} you may ask? Vim is an irreducibly complex text redactor constructed atop the classic Vi\footnote{Vi \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi}{wikipedia}}. It's name is the very essence of it's design paradigm, \emph{Vi} $-$ i\emph{m}proved. It aims to improve efficiency, durability, and capability through a system of dichotomous control; the modes of which, if used properly, become a figurative extension of one's being. Redaction occurs two-fold, in either the \textsc{normal} or \textsc{insert} mode which manipulate and append text, respectively. The irreducible complexity of this time proven ubiquitous design make it an attractive redactor for aspiring engineers such as myself. I have been aware of the existence of Vim for quite some time, however have just recently implemented it as my primary redactor and have relied on it for a respectable amount of time since then\footnote{This assignment was completed in Vim}. Therefore, before society returns to normalcy from this coerced academic hiatus, my goal is to master Vim key-bindings without relying on visualization (i.e. \emph{looking at the keyboard}) or memorization, (\emph{muscle memory is quicker}, \emph{therefore more efficient}). Although these aspirations may seem trivial allow the attached links to assure you of the contrary. \\
