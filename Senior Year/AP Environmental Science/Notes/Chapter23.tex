\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Economics — Goods and services

  \item Economic System — Social institution (\textit{ex. socialism, communism, capitalism, etc.})

  \item Free-Market System — Based on supply and demand

  \item Natural Capital — Resources provided by the Earth's natural processes

  \item Human Capital — People's physical and mental talents

  \item Manufactured Capital — Tools and materials

  \item Economic Growth

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Increased capacity to supply goods and services

      \item Requires increased production and consumption

      \item Requires more consumers

    \end{itemize}

  \item Economic Development

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Improvement of living standards

    \end{itemize}

  \item Environmentally Sustainable Economic Development — Environmentally beneficial

  \item Use resources more sustainably:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Full-cost Pricing — Includes estimated costs of harmful environmental and health effects of production

      \item Subsidizing environmentally beneficial goods and services

      \item Taxing pollution and waste instead of wages and profits
        
    \end{itemize}

  \item Cap-and-Trade — Incentive based; Used to reduce \ce{SO2}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Cap on greenhouse gas emissions is a limit backed by science. Companies pay penalties if they exceed the cap, which gets stricter over time

      \item Trade is a market for companies to buy and sell allowances that permit them to emit only a certain amount. Trading gives companies a strong incentive to save money by cutting emissions

    \end{itemize}

  \item Poverty — People can not meet basic needs

    \begin{itemize}

      \item One-fifth of the world's population lives on less than \$1.25 per day

    \end{itemize}

  \item Reducing poverty helps reduce:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Population growth

      \item Resource use

      \item Environmental degradation

    \end{itemize}

  \item Microlending

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Microloans give hope to the poor

      \item Microloans help more than direct aid. Why?

        \begin{itemize}

          \item \$5 to \$500

          \item Mostly to women

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
