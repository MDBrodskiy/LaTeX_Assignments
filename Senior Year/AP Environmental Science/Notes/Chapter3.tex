\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Organisms $\rightarrow$ Population (All of a given species in one area at the same time) $\rightarrow$ Community (The interactions between all species in an area) $\rightarrow$ Ecosystems (Biomes; can also incorporate temperature and other non-living things) $\rightarrow$ Biosphere (All life on Earth)

  \item Trophic Levels — Producers $\rightarrow$ Primary Consumers $\rightarrow$ Secondary Consumers $\rightarrow$ Tertiary Consumers, etc.

  \item Herbivores — Primary consumers; eat producers; teeth designed for grinding

  \item Carnivores — Meat eaters only; feed on primary consumers (herbivores); teeth designed for shredding

  \item Omnivores — Eat anything; feeding on other carnivores makes them tertiary consumers; looking at our teeth, we are omnivores

\end{enumerate}
