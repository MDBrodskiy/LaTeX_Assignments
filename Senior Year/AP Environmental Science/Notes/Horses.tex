\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Horse overpopulation threaten the health of the horses themselves and many other plant species

  \item Native Americans captured some horses and domesticated them for travel and use in the fields

  \item Cavalries relied on sturdy horses

  \item Many horses escaped and became a nuisance on vegetation and soil

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Many people hunted horses for sport

      \item Velma Johnston worked to better the conditions for horses

    \end{itemize}

  \item Wild Horse Annie Act of 1959 fell short of Johnston's goals, as it simply banned the use of aircraft and motorized vehicles to round up horses

  \item The Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 demarcated Johnston's success

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Horses were to be protected, inventoried, and have established areas in a range

      \item The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 gave the Bureau of Land Management the authority to use helicopters and certain vehicles to humanely herd horses

    \end{itemize}

  \item Horse overgrazing has caused a decline in horse populations, and, for this reason, the horse population needs to be managed

  \item It takes 300 hours to train to become a horse-guiding helicopter pilot

\end{enumerate}
