\title{Environmental Problems, Their Causes, and Sustainability}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Environment — Everything around us

  \item Environmental Science — Interdisciplinary science connecting information and ideas from:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Natural Sciences (ecology, biology, geology, chemistry)

      \item Social Sciences (geography, politics, economies)

      \item Humanities (ethics, philosophy)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Renewable vs. Nonrenewable

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Resources — Anything that has been obtained from the environment to meet our needs

      \item Renewable Resource — Takes several days to several hundred years to renew (Ex. Plants, Water, Air, Animals, etc.)

      \item Nonrenewable Resources — A finite stock on Earth (Ex. Fossil Fuels, Ores and Metals, etc.)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Countries: Resource Use and Environmental Impact

    \begin{itemize}

      \item More-developed Countries — Industrialized nations with high average income (roughly 17\% of the world's population)

      \item Less-developed Countries — 83\% of the world's population

    \end{itemize}

  \item Ecological Footprints

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Amount of biologically productive land and water needed to provide a person or area with renewable resources, and to recycle wastes and pollution

      \item Ecological Deficit — Footprint is larger than biological capacity for replenishment

      \item IPAT — $I=PAT$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $I$ is the total impact

          \item $P$ is the population

          \item $A$ is the affluence

          \item $T$ is the technology

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Three major cultural events increased the human ecological footprint:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Agricultural Revolution

      \item Industrial-medical Revolution

      \item Information-globalization Revolution

      \item There is a current need for a sustainability revolution

    \end{itemize}

  \item Causes of Environmental Problems:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Population growth

      \item Wasteful/unsustainable resource use

      \item Poverty

      \item Price of goods does not reflect harmful environmental effects

      \item Increasing isolation from nature

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Human Population

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Exponential Growth — Population increases at a fixed percentage per unit time

      \item No one knows how many people the Earth can support indefinitely

    \end{itemize}

  \item Affluence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Harmful environmental impact

        \begin{itemize}

          \item High levels of consumption

          \item High levels of pollution

          \item Unnecessary waste of resources

        \end{itemize}

      \item Beneficial environmental impact

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Funds for developing technologies to reduce: pollution, environmental degradation, resource waste

        \end{itemize}

      \item Affluence — Wealth; Allows to consume large amounts of resources far beyond their basic needs

      \item Affluenza — Unsustainable addiction to over-consumption and materialism exhibited in the lifestyle of affluent consumers in the United States and other developed countries

    \end{itemize}

  \item An Environmentally Sustainable Society

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Living Sustainably — Living off the Earth's natural income without depleting or degrading the natural capital that supplies it

      \item Environmentally Sustainable Society — Meets the current needs in a just and equitable manner without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs

      \item Natural Income — Renewable resources

      \item The Anthropocene — A new era in which humans have become major agents of change in the functioning of Earth's life as ecological footprints have spread

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
