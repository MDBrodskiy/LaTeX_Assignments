\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Open Economy

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $AD = C + I + G + $\begin{tabular}{|c|}\hline \hl{$NX$}\\ \hline \end{tabular}$\longleftarrow$ focus of this chapter 

    \end{itemize}

  \item Four Factors in an Open Economy:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Balance of Payments

      \item Exchange Rates

      \item Role of Central Bank

      \item Barriers to Trade

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Some Basics:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Countries don't trade with each other — people do

      \item Financial capital (money) flows all around the world seeking the highest possible return

      \item In the \nth{21} century, making a financial investment in another country is a simple click away

      \item People want to be paid in their domestic currency

    \end{itemize}

  \item Balance of Payments Accounts — A summary of the country's transactions with other countries. There are two main types of transactions:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item People trading currently produced goods or services for money

      \item People trading pre-existing assets for money

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Capital Account — Flow of currently produced goods and services

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Net exports

      \item Net financial investment income (income and dividend income)

      \item Net transfers (remittances and foreign aid)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Financial Account — Flow of Financial Capital (Pre-existing Assets)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Real assets

      \item Financial assets

    \end{itemize}

  \item A deficit in one will be matched by a surplus in the other: $CA + FA = 0$

  \item Debits and Credits

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Debit (-) — Any transaction that requires foreign currency (\textit{i.e.} imports, money outflows)

      \item Credit (+) — Any transaction that earns foreign currency (\textit{i.e.} exports, money inflows)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Foreign Exchange

    \begin{itemize}

      \item An increase in the demand for one currency results in an increase in supply for another

    \end{itemize}

  \item Determinants of Demand for Currency

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Tastes and preferences

      \item Price Level — Inflation tends to depreciate currencies (don't conflate domestic monetary policy and foreign exchange markets)

      \item National income and relative income changes

      \item Interest rates

      \item Speculation/expectations

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
