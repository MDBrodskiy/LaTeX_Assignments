\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item GDP and Prices

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Focus needs to be on growth \undeline{not} prices

      \item To compensate, we use a price index

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Choose a base year

          \item Choose a market basket of goods and services

        \end{itemize}

      \item Consumer Price Index (CPI)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Thousands of consumer items

          \item Base years 1982$-$1984 (average of those)

          \item Compiled monthly

          \item $CPI = \frac{y_{curr}}{y_{base}}\cdot100$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Real vs. Current GDP

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Nominal or current — \underline{Not} adjusted for inflation

          \item Real — \underline{Adjusted} for inflation

        \end{itemize}

      \item GDP per capita is useful for comparison of countries

      \item CPI vs. GDP Deflator

        \begin{center}
          \begin{tabular}{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
            \hline
            GDP Deflator & CPI\\
            \hline
            Ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP & Measure of a cost of a market basket of consumer goods\\
            \hline
            Counts all goods and services produced domestically & Counts all goods and services bought by consumers\\
            \hline
          \end{tabular}
        \end{center}

      \item GDP Deflator

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $r_{GDP} = \frac{GDP_{nom}}{GDP_{def}}\cdot 100$

          \item Any “real” calculation uses the simple formula $r_{x} = \frac{nominal}{index}\cdot 100$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Inflation:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Winners: Debtors

          \item Losers: Creditors

        \end{itemize}

      \item Interest can be conceptualized as “rent” on money

      \item Interest rate formula:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item $nominal = real + inflation$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Business Cycles

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Regular and systematic fluctuations in the level of total output as measured in terms of real GDP

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Recession — When real GDP declines for two quarters in a row

          \item Expansion — Recovery from a recession

          \item Business cycles are like earthquakes because:

            \begin{itemize}

              \item It is known that they will occur

              \item No one knows when they will occur

              \item No one knows how intense they will be or how long they will last

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item Influences on Business Cycles:

        \begin{enumerate}

          \item Innovations

          \item Monetary Factors

          \item External Shocks

        \end{enumerate}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Unemployment

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Unemploued — Not working at present, but have made an effort to find work in the last four weeks. Doesn't account for “dropouts” or “discouraged” workers

      \item Employed — Work for pay a minimum of one hour per week \underline{or} without pay in a family enterprise a minimum of 15 hours

      \item Unemployment Formulas:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Unemployment Rate: $\frac{Unemployed}{labor\text{ }force}$

          \item Labor Force: $employed + unemployed$

          \item Labor Force Participation Rate: $\frac{labor\text{ }force}{population_{\text{16+}}}$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
