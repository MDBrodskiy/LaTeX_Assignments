\begin{enumerate}

  \item Impact of Monetary Policy

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Interest rates matter

      \item The Money Market

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Transaction Demand: NOT a function of interest rates, but a function of economic activity (\textit{i.e.\ money as a medium of exchange})

          \item Asset Demand: Money as a store of value. The opportunity cost of holding money is the interest rate you could be earning. Erosion due to inflation is another cost

        \end{itemize}

      \item The Money Market Model

      \item Nominal Interest Rate vs. Quantity of Money — The graph is downward-sloping

      \item The nominal interest rate $i$ is the Federal Funds rate

      \item Only the Fed can shift the supply of money

      \item Shifters of transaction demand

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Changes in GDP

          \item Changes in price level

          \item Changes in technology

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
