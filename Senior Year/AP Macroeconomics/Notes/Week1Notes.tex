\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item There is no such thing as a f*** lunch

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Everything has a cost (\textit{i.e.\ opportunity cost})

    \end{itemize}

  \item People respond to incentives

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Incentives motivate people to do things (can be negative or positive)

    \end{itemize}

  \item The fundamental problem facing all societies is \underline{scarcity}

  \item Given the problem of scarcity, all societies must answer the three basic questions:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item What to produce

      \item How to produce

      \item For whom to produce

    \end{itemize}

  \item Command economies have the government decide what, how, and for whom to produce goods

  \item Factors of Production (Necessary for production to take place):

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Land (gifts of nature — \textit{i.e.\ navigable rivers, ocean access, etc.})

      \item Labor (\textit{i.e.\ human capital})

      \item Capital (tools — \textit{i.e.\ computers, bulldozers, etc.})

      \item \textit{Optional: Entrepreneurship}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Guide to Economic Reasoning

    \begin{itemize}

      \item People Choose — People choose the alternative that seems best to them because it involves the least cost and the greatest benefit (people economize)

      \item People's Choices Involve Costs — Opportunity cost is the second best alternative people give up in making a choice

        \begin{itemize}

          \item One way to view these costs is with a production possibilities curve

            \begin{center}

                \begin{tikzpicture}
                  \begin{axis}[xmin=0, xlabel={Good $x$}, ylabel={Good $y$}, ymin=0, ymajorgrids=true, xmajorgrids=true, grid style=dashed]
                      \addplot[color=blue]{(25 - x^2)^.5};
                      \node[label={180:{Efficient}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt, color=blue!50] at (axis cs:3,4) {};
                      \node[label={180:{Feasible}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt, color=green!50] at (axis cs:2,1) {};
                      \node[label={180:{Infeasible}},circle,fill,inner sep=2pt, color=red!50] at (axis cs:5,5) {};
                    \end{axis}
                \end{tikzpicture}
              
            \end{center}

        \end{itemize}

      \item People respond to incentives in predictable ways — Incentives are benefits or rewards that encourage people to act. When incentives change, people's choices change

      \item People create economic systems, and these systems influence incentives and people's choices — How people cooperate is governed by written and unwritten rules. As rules change, incentives change and choices change

      \item People gain when they trade voluntarily — People can produce more in less time by concentrating on what they do best. The surplus goods or services they produce can be traded for other valuable goods or services

    \end{itemize}

  \item Terminology

    \begin{itemize}

      \item When someone is better at something than someone else, they have an \underline{absolute advantage} (\textit{i.e.\ a plumber has an absolute advantage in plumbing})

      \item Comparative advantage is used to compare which choice is better through comparison of opportunity costs. Essentially, the best choice is wherever the opportunity cost is the lowest

      \item Advantage problems:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Output or input

          \item Who has absolute advantage

          \item Calculate opportunity costs

          \item Who has comparative advantage

          \item Determine terms of trade

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
