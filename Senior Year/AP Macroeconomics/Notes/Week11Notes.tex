\begin{enumerate}

  \item National Debt

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Debt — An accumulation of deficits

      \item Deficit — The amount gained or owed in a certain amount of time (usually an annual number) that represents the difference in income and spending

        \begin{itemize}
            
          \item Trade Deficit — When imports are greater than exports

          \item Budget Deficit — When spending exceeds income

        \end{itemize}

      \item National Debt — Too much spending, not enough income

      \item Entitlement — Something received from the government when one qualifies for it (\textit{i.e.} social security, food stamps, etc)

      \item “Crowding Out” — Government spending increases, which increases AD.\ This, in turn, increases the demand for loanable funds, which increases interest rate.\ The increase in interest rates decreases AD, creating a cycle of “crowding out” (investment keeps decreasing, government spending keeps increasing)

      \item Interest expenses crowd out other spending

      \item Composition of spending: investment v.\ consumption

      \item When investors become less confident, they are less willing to invest

    \end{itemize}

  \item Types/Causes of Inflation

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Demand-Pull Inflation — Demand, in tandem with limited supply, pulls prices higher

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Excessive monetary growth

        \end{itemize}

      \item Cost-Push Inflation — Results from shifts in the aggregate supply curve, usually supply shocks

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Quantity Theory of Money

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A theory that emphasizes the positive relationship between the price level and the money supply

      \item The equation of exchange: $M\cdot V = P\cdot Q$, where $M$ is the quantity of money, $V$ is the velocity, $P$ is the price level, and $Q$ is the real GDP

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Velocity is the measure of the rate of exchange of a dollar, and can be measured by: nominal GDP / money supply

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Phillips Curve:

    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[xmin=0, ymin=0, xmax=10, title={Short-run Phillips Curve}, xlabel={Unemployment (\%)}, ylabel={Annual Inflation Rate (\%)}, ymajorgrids=true, xmajorgrids=true, grid style=dashed]
          \addplot[domain=.5:9.5,blue] {(.1 * x) ^ -1};
        \end{axis}
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item As output increases, unemployment decreases because more workers are needed

      \item An AD shift results in movement along the SRPC

      \item Stagflation or an aggregate supply shock will shift the SRPC to the right/up 

      \item Decreases in inflation and unemployment (an increase in AS) will shift the SRPC to the left/down

      \item SRAS and SRPC shift in opposite directions

      \item Expected inflation will shift the SRPC to the right/up

      \item Economists believe the relationship between expected inflation and changes in actual inflation is one-to-one

      \item In the long run Phillips curve, there is no trade-off. The long run Phillips curve is vertical at the unemployment rate consistent with full output

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Factors that influence unemployment in the long run are NOT affected by money supply
            
            \begin{itemize}

              \item Market power of unions

              \item Process of job search

              \item Unemployment benefits

              \item Minimum wage laws

            \end{itemize}

        \end{itemize}

      \item The only sustainable combination of inflation and unemployment on the SRPC is where it intersects the LRPC because that is the only unemployment rate consistent with potential GDP (“Home Base”)

      \item This is analogous to “long run equilibrium” in our ADAS model

      \item The LRPC and the SRPC intersect at the expected rate of inflation
