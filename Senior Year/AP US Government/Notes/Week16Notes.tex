\begin{itemize}

  \item Stare Decisis — A latin term that means to “let the decision stand”. This means that the courts decision now serves as a precedent for all lower courts, including state courts

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Precedent — Means to serve as a model for all similar cases. It is used by the lower courts to guide their decisions. Lower courts can not go against it.

    \end{itemize}

  \item Advisory Opinions — Supreme Court can not give advisory opinions or rulings on a law or action that has not been challenged in the courts first (this would violate separation of powers)

  \item Solicitor General — Represents U.S.\ government before the Supreme Court when there is a case involving the Executive branch

  \item Cases in which Stare Decisis was overturned:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item \textit{Brown v. Board of Education} overturned \textit{Plessy v. Ferguson}

      \item \textit{Wolf v. Colorado} overturned \textit{Mapp v. Ohio}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
