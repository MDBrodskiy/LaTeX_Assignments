\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item Anti-federalists wanted a guarantee of rights, which manifested itself in the form of the Bill of Rights

  \item States wanted amendments

  \item Federalist Papers \#10 was the answer to Brutus \#1

  \item The Federalist Papers: No. 10

    \begin{itemize}

      \item A free republic can not succeed over a country of such immense extent (in reference to Baron de Montesquieu, \textit{Spirit of Laws}, chap. xvi.\ vol.\ I [book VIII])

      \item Popular governments — Pure democracy

      \item “The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils, have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished”

      \item Failure is necessary in a free republic

      \item “\dots not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority”

      \item “Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it could not be less folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction, than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential to animal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency”

      \item Factions arise from human nature (as does property, which may cause factions)

      \item Source of factions is the “various and unequal distribution of property”

      \item “Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm”

      \item Majority rule with minority rights

      \item Pure democracy limited by the majority

      \item “Hence it is that such democracies [pure democracies] have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths”

      \item “Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions”

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
