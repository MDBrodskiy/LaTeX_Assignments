\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item There are 435 members of the House of Representatives

  \item Great Compromise — Created a House of Representatives based on population

  \item Created a senate based on equality (2 per state = 100)

  \item Congress contains 535 members (100 from senate + 435 from HoR)

  \item Minimum majority to win in the electoral college is 270

  \item A census occurs every 10 years, at the beginning of a decade (2020, 2030, 2040, etc.)

  \item Ordered Liberty:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Separation of Powers [Branches]

      \item Checks + Balances [Branches + Federalism]

      \item Federalism: Division of Power between Federal \& State Government

      \item Popular Sovereignty [Majority Rule w/ Minority Rights]

      \item Judicial Review

      \item Limited Government [Positive Law (Art. 1, Sect. 8) + Negative Law (Art. 1, Sect. 9/10)]

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Congress raises all of its money through taxes

  \item Congress controls fiscal policy; the Federal Reserve controls monetary policy

  \item Congress has the right to borrow in the name of the United States

  \item Congress has used the commerce clause to grow its powers exponentially

    \begin{itemize}

      \item \textit{United States v. Lopez} — Congress had exceeded its commerce clause power by prohibiting guns in a school zone

    \end{itemize}

  \item The electors in the electoral college equal the number of people in the senate plus the house

  \item The Northwest Ordinance (1787) did two things:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Allowed all new states to come in on an equal basis with the original states

      \item Banned slavery from the Northwest Territory

    \end{itemize}

  \item From the Northwest Territory, several states were established, including Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin

  \item Slavery already existed in the southern territories

  \item The constitution neither condones nor condemns slavery

  \item Populations change through external immigration or internal migration (ex. The Great Migration)

  \item State legislatures control the redrawing of congressional districts

  \item California is controlled by Democrats

  \item Gerrymandering is constitutional

  \item In a parliamentary system the legislative and executive branches are one and the same

  \item We elect people from where we live

  \item In the HOR, we elect people in a single-member district

  \item Single-member districts mean the winner takes all

  \item Plurality: The winner gets more votes than the next person, but less than majority (true for HoR and Senate)

  \item December 8, 1941 was the last time war was declared in the US (against Japan)

  \item People “rally around the flag”

\end{itemize}
