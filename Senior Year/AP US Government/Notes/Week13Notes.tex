  \item Congressional Elections

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Every member of the House of Representatives seat is up for reelection, while a third of the Senate seats are also up every two years (33 or 34)

      \item About 90\% of incumbents in the House and 85\% in the Senate are usually reelected

    \end{itemize}

  \item Congressional Statistics

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The average age is 56 years

      \item The average member is white, male, protestant, and a lawyer

      \item The average term length is 9.3 years

    \end{itemize}

  \item Incumbent Advantages

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Name Recognition

      \item Franking Privilege (Free Mail)

      \item Full staffs 22 Senate/17 House

      \item Committees in each house for each party that raise money for their members

      \item 90\% of all Political Action Committee money is given to incumbents

      \item Constituent Services

      \item Federal campaign finance laws favorite incumbents over challengers

    \end{itemize}

  \item Political Action Committee (PAC) — A popular term for a political committee organized for the purpose of raising and spending money to elect and defeat candidates

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Anyone, including members of Congress, can start a political action committee

      \item PACs started by politicians are often referred to as Leadership PACs

      \item SuperPACs do not contribute to candidates or parties; they may make independent expenditures in federal races, such as running ads, sending mail, or communicating in other ways (independent expenditure groups)

      \item Roughly 2900 SuperPACs and 8000 PACs exist

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The original campaign financing act

      \item Created the Federal Election Commission (FEC)

      \item Created dollar limits that individuals could donate to candidates

      \item Any money given directly to a single candidate is known as a hard dollar

    \end{itemize}

  \item Carey Committees

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Known as Hybrid PACs

      \item One account acts as a political committee, another acts as an account for independent expenditures

    \end{itemize}

  \item 527 Organization

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Nonprofit groups

      \item Have to disclose donors

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Shield identities through loopholes

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Redistribution

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Congress has to redistribute the seats after each decennial census

      \item States win or lose seats based on their population gains or losses (CA has 52)

      \item California Population 2000 = 33,871,648

      \item California Population 2019 = 39,539,223

      \item One seat represents roughly 730,000 people per the 2020 US Census

      \item California lost a seat after the last census (used to be 53)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Constituent — A person who makes up a congressional district

  \item Gerrymandering — The redrawing of district boundaries to favor the party in power (mostly legal)

  \item Foreign policy lies under responsibilities of the Senate

  \item Senators represent an entire state

    \begin{itemize}

      \item When a person represents the entire state as their Congressional district, this is called an “At-Large” seat

    \end{itemize}

  \item Reapportionment

    \begin{itemize}

      \item After the seats are redistributed, state legislatures divide their states into the allotted number of districts

      \item Each district must be a compact, contiguous territory and have relatively the same number of people in each one

      \item \textit{Baker v. Carr} (1962) — Supreme Court decided it could hear cases regarding the drawing of boundary lines

      \item \textit{Wesberry v. Sanders} (1964) — The US Supreme Court ruled that congressional districts should be close to equal in population, which would mean one man equals one vote

    \end{itemize}

  \item Two Methods of Gerrymandering:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Concentrate opposing voters in one or few districts to protect seats (“packing”)

      \item Spread the opposition thin to limit the ability for a party to carry any district (“cracking”)

    \end{enumerate}

  \item “Open seat” when there is no incumbent (most competitive)

  \item “Safe seat” when a district is developed through cracking (least competitive)

  \item In midterm elections, the party in power in the House and Senate normally loses seats

  \item From 1954 to 1994, Democrats controlled the House

  \item Majority-Minority districts were created by a few states to increase the likelihood of minority representation

  \item \textit{Shaw v. Reno} 1993 — Supreme Court ruled that, while race could not be the controlling factor in drawing districts, it could be in a mix of factors in the process

  \item Senate

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Often called the upper house

      \item The US Constitution grants each state two senators

      \item The framershoped that a smaller and more exclusive Senate would be more enlightened and responsible than the House

      \item The first Congress had 22 members, now there are 100

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
