\begin{itemize}

  \item The Constitution:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The House of Representatives is directly elected

      \item Senators are chosen by legislatures of each state (indirect election — changed by the seventeenth amendment, now direct)

    \end{itemize}

  \item The word “vested” means that an entity is authorized to use certain, delegated powers

  \item The government was intentionally made slow and cumbersome through checks and balances

\end{itemize}
