\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item Under the Articles of Confederation, there was no regulated interstate trade, which resulted in many going hungry as states refused to pay each others tariffs

  \item Article I Section 8 is an example of “Positive Law,” which lists the powers granted to Congress (also called the enumerated powers)

  \item Article I Section 9 is an example of “Negative Law,” which lists the powers denied to Congress

  \item The writ of Habeas Corpus comes from the Magna Carta

  \item No Bill of Attainder — A law passed by Congress to take away a persons life, liberty, or property by majority vote only

  \item No Ex Post Facto laws — A bill making something that was legal now illegal after the fact


  \item Amendments — Congress proposes, States ratify

    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|p{.45\textwidth}|p{.45\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        \begin{center}Propose\end{center} & \begin{center}Approve/Ratify\end{center}\\
        \hline
        Amendments are proposed by two-thirds of both the House of Reps.\ and the Senate & Three-fourths of the state legislatures\newline ($\frac{3}{4}$ of 50 $\rightarrow 38$)\\
        \hline
        Application of two-thirds of the state legislatures to Congress to call a convention for proposing amendments (never used) & Conventions in three-fourths of the States (used once — twenty-first amendment)\\
        \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

  \item There are no term limits at the federal level

  \item Article V is a great example of federalism

  \item A super majority for ratification is necessary because only the most important issues should be amended

  \item The Articles of Confederation created nothing more than a league of friendship. Some weaknesses were:

    \begin{itemize}
        
      \item Could not levy taxes

      \item Could not regulate commerce
        
      \item Had an army in name only (no real army) — Also, no navy

      \item No national judicial or executive branch to interpret and enforce laws, respectively

      \item Amendment required all thirteen states to agree

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Articles of Confederation created 13 countries (each state was its own sovereign, independent nation) — Simple majority was 7/13 and 9/13 was a super majority (laws needed 9/13 votes to be passed)

  \item Per the Articles of Confederation, delegates were picked and paid for by the state legislature (which meant delegates acted more as a United Nations, where each state acted in its own interest)

  \item The Continental Congress had only one chamber, which meant it was fast and efficient

  \item How do you design a government that does the least amount of harm and will be able to stand the test of time?


    \begin{itemize}

      \item A government should be initialized in such a way that it has the least amount of power necessary to function
        
    \end{itemize}

  \item Six Pillars of Constitutional Ordered Liberty

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Separation of Powers (Three Branches)

      \item Checks and Balances (allowed by the separation of the branches)

      \item Federalism (Separation of power between state and federal government)

      \item Popular Sovereignty (Majority Rule with Minority Rights)
        
      \item Judicial Review (deciding the constitutionality of laws)

      \item Limited Government (Negative Laws \& Positive Laws)

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Individual liberty \& Individual responsibility

          \item Economic freedom

          \item Rule of Law

          \item Free repeating and regular elections

          \item Competing political parties

          \item Citizen Participation

        \end{itemize}

    \end{enumerate}

  \item None of these items are up for negotiation no matter which party wins. They are almost universally accepted as the bedrock of our republic and the safeguards to our liberties

  \item Powers are delegated from the people to the Constitution

  \item Federalist Paper \#45 shows the origins of dual federalism

\end{itemize}
