\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

  \item Letter to Martin Luther King (April 12,1963)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Criticizes MLK for inciting violence and disorder

      \item Law enforcement “urged” to show restraint

      \item Commends law enforcement, puts down protesters 

    \end{itemize}

  \item In 1955:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Joanne Robinson is an important figure leading the Civil Rights movement

      \item Emmett Till murdered

      \item Dr. King joins the movement

    \end{itemize}

  \item Around the time the movement began, there were 50,000 people living in Montgomery

  \item The Montgomery Bus Boycott lasted 13 months

  \item November 1956 — US Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's racial segregation laws for buses were unconstitutional

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Limited to buses and Alabama (segregation allowed elsewhere)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Two forms of fighting: civil disobedience and litigation

  \item Leading group for African-Americans at the time was the NAACP

  \item Thurgood Marshall first African-American on the Supreme Court

  \item The Little Rock Nine in 1957 (integration of Central High School)

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Media is one of the biggest factors pushing change (more press coverage)

      \item Many people have television (allows mass communication)

      \item Governor of Arkansas used the National Guard to bar the kids from entering the school; when this didn't work, he closed ALL public schools in Arkansas

      \item Took 18 years to fully integrate Arkansas schools

    \end{itemize}

  \item George Wallace of Alabama called for segregation forever; in the South, segregation was part of politics

  \item From 1957 to 1963 there were over 20 unsolved bombings in Alabama

  \item “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere” — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., \textit{Letter from a Birmingham Jail}

  \item KKK members were part of city politics (police, government, etc.)

  \item Bail rates were increased to keep more people in jail (contrary to amendment 8)

  \item Bull Connor held an elected position

  \item When children marched with parents, firemen refused to attack the protesters with hoses

  \item Protesters took direct action in the form of sit-ins, marches, and much more, but maintained a policy of non-violence

  \item In Brutus I:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The people are the fountain of power

      \item “An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself”

      \item “Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application”

      \item Constitution is inadequate to protect our rights

    \end{itemize}

  \item In Letter From a Birmingham Jail:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Civil disobedience is promoted, along with many historical events (Gandhi, Socrates, Boston Tea Party)

      \item All men should respect the dignity and worth of human personality

      \item People have to work to confirm their rights

      \item Refers to “birthright of freedom” (John Locke's idea of natural rights)

      \item “Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother”

    \end{itemize}

  \item \textit{Mapp v. Ohio}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Concerned search and seizure (warrants)

      \item Warrants must be signed by a judge to determine whether probable cause exists; warrants do not require a persons agreement

      \item Was necessary because there were several states that did not require search warrants

      \item Established the exclusionary rule (evidence that does not relate or was obtained without a warrant may not be used in a case)

    \end{itemize}

  \item Incorporation — Applying a federal right to a state through a court case (Ex. Fourteenth Amendment, \textit{Mapp v. Ohio})

  \item \textit{Wolf v. Colorado} applied the fourth amendment to the states (did not apply the exclusionary rule)

  \item Amici Curiae — Friend of the court (an adviser)

\end{itemize}
