\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Visual & Auditory & Tactile\\ \hline Moon falling down & “Warren” & Dew\\ Light poured & Played unheard some tenderness & Put out her hand\\ Harp-like & & \\ \hline\end{tabular}

  \item Throughout the poem, gentle visual, auditory, and tactile imagery is used to put the reader in a sense of ease. The announcement, signifying death, seems more like a liberation of the soul rather than the loss of a loved one. This is achieved, for example, by the description of the moon and its light pouring down. The announcer of death is described as a female who “played unheard some tenderness”, among the harp-like morning-glory strings. This setting and description gives a calming effect. As such, the imagery has the effect of an ethereal gentleness regarding the announcement, in addition to giving the announcement of death a positive feeling.
