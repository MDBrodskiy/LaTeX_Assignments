\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}

  \item The speaker has an attitude of admiration and gentleness regarding the woman in the poem. This attitude is evident through the way he describes her actions: “a sleepy pirouette”, “dancing slowly”, and “falling glide.” Such elegant movements strengthen the author's admirational tone, and her movements, coupled with the descriptions of her (“a reverie of the place”), further the gentleness.

  \item The last line of the poem holds a concise conclusion regarding the woman in question. The \textit{adverb adjective, adverb adjective} syntax creates a short and memorable statement, as the author complements the woman as “[p]erfectly beautiful, perfectly ignorant of it.”

\end{enumerate}
