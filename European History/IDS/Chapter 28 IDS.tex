\begin{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}

\item  \underline{James Connolly (\emph{Sheamus \'O'Connolly})} $-$ A Scottish born Irish Marxist responsible for conglomerating Irish paramilitary and socialist worker's groups to form the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) during the early days of the Irish republican nationalist movements. He was sentenced to death by firing squad, among fifteen other members of the IRB, for his participation in the 1916 Easter Sunday uprising. His memory, kept alive in poems and provisional army songs, became that of a martyred, loyal son of Ireland, and contributed to the growing tensions between the oppressing British constabulary and rebelling Irish citizenry. His death allowed for the promotion of junior and middle-management Irish Republicans such as Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, and \`Eamon de Valera to assume senior leadership positions in the Irish Republican government. \\\vspace{8pt}\emph{Also, James Connolly had a gnarly mustache}

\item \underline{Michael Collins} $-$ Lead the revolution as Chairman of the Provisional Irish Government following the death of James Connolly. He organized the independence of 26 Irish counties after a period of negotiation with Britain following a mutual ceasefire. The longevity of the Provisional Government was contingent on the reception of the Anglo-Irish treaty by the Irish citizenry who disrupted into civil war following the rejection of allegiance to the crown. Fighting occurred predominantly around the north six counties where the Royal Ulster Constabulary maintained a military presence. The ensuing chaos is referred to as the troubles. Michael Collins died in an ambushed staged by his former comrades whilst on his way to golden B\'eal na Bl\'ath in 1922.

\item \underline{\`Eamon de Valera} $-$ The only American born Irishman to take up arms during the Easter Sunday uprising, he was spared from execution at  Kilmainham wall on account of his birthplace and enjoyed a fruitful and long political career spanning over half a century. He was the Irish head of state during the emergency (Second World War) and the troubles (Northern Ireland political/religious violence).
